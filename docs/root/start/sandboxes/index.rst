Sandboxes
---------

We've created a number of sandboxes using Docker Compose that set up different
environments to test out Envoy's features and show sample configurations. As we
gauge peoples' interests we will add more sandboxes demonstrating different
features. The following sandboxes are available:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    cache
    cors
    csrf
    ext_authz
    fault_injection
    front_proxy
    grpc_bridge
    jaeger_native_tracing
    jaeger_tracing
    load_reporting_service
    lua
    mysql
    postgres
    redis
    wasm-cc
    zipkin_tracing
