Getting Started
===============

This section gets you started with a very simple configuration and provides some example configurations.

The fastest way to get started using Envoy is :ref:`installing pre-built binaries <install_binaries>`.
You can also :ref:`build it <building>` from source.

These examples use the :ref:`v3 Envoy API <envoy_api_reference>`, but use only the static configuration
feature of the API, which is most useful for simple requirements. For more complex requirements
:ref:`Dynamic Configuration <arch_overview_dynamic_config>` is supported.
